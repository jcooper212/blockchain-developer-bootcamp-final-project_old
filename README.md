DefiWallie - The Swiss Army knife of DefiWallets

# DefiWallie
## Problem Statement
The current Defi experience can be daunting for a new user. Firstly there is a lot of research, a steep learning curve of various tools and protocals and to top that off they are actually spending really money to experiement. In addition to this, the current wallets have a lot of convenience functions which are missing. This is now improving with the newer generation of wallets as well as other dashboards such as zapper.fi and zerion. If only we had a wallet we could trust - but also provided a simple user experience and useful features baked in.

## The Solution
Enter DefiWallie - A smart contract wallet which not only keeps track of your assets but also is built on top of the Compound protocol to automatically generated yield and accrue savings. The wallet will be easy to use with all of the convenience functions that are necessary for a great experience. The idea would be to have a simple wallet - but with all of the convenience functions baked in

## User interaction
A user would use a DefiWallie Factory contract to create a new wallet
They could then fund the wallet with various assets
The assets would automatically earn yield on compound - as well as accrue the COMP governance tokens
The wallet would also do the most common operations such as
- Deposit
- Balance
- Pay
- Withdraw
- Swap

In the second Phase, we would add in more addvanced features such as TWAP Swap as well as integration with other protocols such as Yearn, Rari, TokeMak, Rari
